Time Complexity Comparison
Algorithm	  Best Case	 Average Case	Worst Case	Space
Linear Search	O(1)	   O(n)	           O(n)	     O(1)
Binary Search	O(1)	  O(log n)	      O(log n)	 O(1)

Binary Search is faster only when the data is sorted and random access is available (like arrays).
If the product list is unsorted or in a dynamic structure like a linked list, linear search is necessary.

Which to Use and Why

Scenario									Recommendation

Small/unsorted product dataset				Use Linear Search
Large/sorted product dataset				Use Binary Search
Frequent insertions/deletions				Use Linear (less overhead)
Performance critical read-only search		Use Binary (fast lookup)
